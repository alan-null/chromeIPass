# chromeIPass Documentation

chromeIPass is a browser extension that integrates [KeePass](https://keepass.info) or [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) with Google Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers) to provide seamless password management.

It relies on the [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/alan-null/keepasshttp) plugin, which securely (256-bit AES/CBC) exposes entries over a local HTTP interface.

## Chrome Web Store

Extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeipass/bocdfmfhfcobbagfcbimemeclglilcbk).
