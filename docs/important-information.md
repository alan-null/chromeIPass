## 6. Important information

- because Google Chrome does not offer an API to communicate with the built-in password manager chromeIPass needs to implement its own kind of password manager. [Please read the known limitations which belongs to that](limitations).

- for security reasons chromeIPass wipes out the temporarily stored credentials from cache every time you switch the tabs. Therefor it requests credentials for the current tab every time you switch on it.
