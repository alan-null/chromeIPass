# chromeIPass

chromeIPass is a browser extension that integrates [KeePass](https://keepass.info) or [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org) with Google Chrome (and other Chromium-based browsers) to provide seamless password management.

It relies on the [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/alan-null/keepasshttp) plugin, which securely (256-bit AES/CBC) exposes entries over a local HTTP interface.

## Status / Chrome Web Store

The next major release (**v3**) is currently under active development. The extension is not yet available in the Chrome Web Store.

A Chrome Web Store listing will be published with the **v3** release. (Link will be added here once live.)

Thank you for creating and sharing an extension the community could use for many years for free.
